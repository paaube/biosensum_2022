# BiosensUM 2022

This is the git repository that contains all of the code used by the BiosensUM team for the SensUs competition. We used an LSPR detection on pulled borosilicate fiber tips which is why the code uses Seabreeze to collect data from the OceanOptics USB4000 spectrometer and performs multiple actions on light spectra.

We hope this will be helpful for others!
